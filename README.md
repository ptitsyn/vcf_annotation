# vcf_annotation
a quick hack of a python script to pick a few fields and fetch variant info from ExAC
some calls need extra work - the locus is right, need to break the variant into a series of SNPs, try against ExAC, and keep the 
legitimate variants (or tweak the variant calling routine).
Keep in ming this is a quick hack rather than part of the accumulated code base. The latter should have higher standards.
